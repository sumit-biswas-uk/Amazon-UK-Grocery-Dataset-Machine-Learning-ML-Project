# Amazon UK Grocery Dataset: Machine Learning (ML) Project.


## Overview

This project aims to develop predictive machine learning models for forecasting revenue based on the features of the Amazon UK Grocery Dataset. Revenue prediction is crucial for businesses in formulating effective strategies, optimizing inventory management, and maximizing revenue potential. Leveraging machine learning models, we seek to accurately forecast revenue trends based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises historical data from Amazon UK Grocery, including various features such as product details, sales, revenue, ratings, price etc. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves analysing the dataset to gain insights into its structure, finding amount of missing data and finding number of unique brands. Through statistical summaries, we explore the data to understand its characteristics.

## Data Visualization

Visualization of revenue trends, brand and product performance, relationships between features and target variables, and distributions to understand data characteristics.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves selection of relevant columns, handling missing data, converting date columns to datetime format, and cleaning brand names using string matching techniques.

## Understanding Correlations

Re-evaluation of correlations after data cleaning to determine feature importance and prepare data for machine learning tasks.

## Data Preprocessing

Conversion of date columns to numerical format, splitting data into training and testing sets, and addressing key observations during data preprocessing.

## Machine Learning

Application of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms for revenue prediction, optimization of model's depth and hyperparameters using K-Fold Cross Validation and Grid Search.

## Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the trained machine learning models on unseen data. Metrics such as R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## How to Use

• Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.

• Upload the dataset to your Google Drive or local environment.

• Run the provided code in your preferred environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook).

• Follow the code comments and outputs to understand the analysis process.

• Analyse the generated R-Squared scores, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error for model evaluation.
